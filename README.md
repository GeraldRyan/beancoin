# BEANCOINAPP 
A case study in blockchain.

A personal project, this app was made as part of my case study for a bootcamp
that ended up getting me my first job in tech as a developer.

Recently I have gotten back into it, building it out and deploying it. 

View the current version as hosted on [Heroku](https://beancoin.herokuapp.com/) 

Note that their servers take about 30 seconds to boot up if nobody's been to the visit in a while. Hey- it's free, 
but I will change hosts at some point! 

View some of my [plans](https://github.com/GeraldRyan/beancoin/issues) for building it out - all part of one giant 
learning
experience

The core blockchain model was based on David Katz's blockchain tutorial on Udemy. Thanks David. Your courses are top 
notch.
