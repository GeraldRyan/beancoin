# BEANCOINAPP 
A case study in blockchain 

A personal project, learning how to code in basic java. This app was made as part of my case study for a bootcamp 
that ended up getting me my first job in tech as a developer. 

The core blockchain model was based on David Katz's blockchain tutorial on Udemy. Thanks David. 

I Transpiled from Python into Java. I added the MVC frontpage. TODO I will build an Angular Front End Client and 
build out the REST API as necessary. 

I will also do many many other things here, to learn, and grow and present, including many Spring modules, Swagger and 
Kafka. 

It is about learning and having fun.
