# BEANCOINAPP 
A case study in blockchain.

A personal project, this app was made as part of my case study for a bootcamp
that ended up getting me my first job in tech as a developer.

Recently I have gotten back into it, building it out and deploying it. 

View the current beta WIP nonprod version as hosted on [Heroku](https://beancoin.herokuapp.com/)

Note that their servers take about 30 seconds to boot up if nobody's been to the visit in a while. Hey- it's free, 
but I will change hosts at some point! 

Of note, I just discovered these wonderful pages:  
https://www.blockchain.com/api/blockchain_api  
https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/

And will be using them to converge my app if not to the bitcoin spec identically, then closer to it. Best way to 
learn is to build

experience

The core blockchain model was based on David Katz's blockchain tutorial on Udemy. Thanks David. Your courses are top 
notch.
