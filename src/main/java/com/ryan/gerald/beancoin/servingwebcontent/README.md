This is working! Now we have a pattern. We have the Controller part down- 

Thanks Boot! 

We can make controllers and link them to Thymeleaf *.html files. 

Now there are several tasks- 
- migrate the JSPs to HTMLS skeletally - don't worry about data pulling
- Migrate the Database Model entity classes 

Where am I specifying to create all the tables? I might need to provision the tables if they don't exist, but not populate them. 
Are they are provisioned by JPA/JDBC when the first reference or call to them is made in a class? 

Must look at the data model config. 

This is a little personal project. As above, so below- data at a large organization (where money is)
