Spring Boot Thymeleaf  -  

where do I put the html templates? 

- By default, Spring Boot configures the Thymeleaf template engine to read template files from /resources/templates .

So I move the jsp views from src>main>java>webapp>WEB-INF>views
to src>main>resources>templates

What makes it be there in the first place? Is it the xml config file I had? 


What is the extension of a thymeleaf file?
